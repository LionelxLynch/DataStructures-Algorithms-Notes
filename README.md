# Data Structures and Algorithms Notes

This repository contains a collection of concise notes on various data structures and algorithms implemented in Java. The primary purpose of this repository is to serve as a resource for code inspections and to aid in understanding and implementing these fundamental concepts efficiently.

## Contents

- **Data Structures**: Detailed explanations and Java/Python implementations of common data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
- **Algorithms**: In-depth explanations and Java implementations of essential algorithms including sorting, searching, graph traversal, dynamic programming, and more.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Analysis of time complexity and space complexity for each data structure and algorithm, helping you understand their efficiency characteristics.
- **Best Use Cases**: Insights into the practical use cases where specific data structures and algorithms excel, guiding you in choosing the appropriate solutions for different scenarios.

Feel free to explore the code and accompanying notes to enhance your knowledge and improve your understanding of data structures and algorithms in Java.

Please note that this repository focuses on providing code samples and explanations rather than being an application itself. It serves as a reference for studying and inspecting code implementations of various data structures and algorithms.
